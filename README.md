# AoC Kotlin Template
Every day is in days/DayN.kt<br>
Uncomment days in Main.kt to run them<br>
To run:<br>
- change the year in AOCInteractions.kt<br>
- create a file (excluded from git, I use Private.kt) with your sesssion token (gotten from browser storage, file should look like this: `const val session: String = "token here"`)
